This project builds a depression detection model for Instagram captions using BiLSTM with an attention mechanism. We're tackling the important issue of mental health on social media, aiming to spot depressive language and help those struggling in silence. Missing these signs could mean losing a chance to make a real difference. Weâ€™ve used technologies like Python, TensorFlow, and NLP techniques, and taken care to handle data responsibly and address biases, showing our commitment to compassionate and ethical AI. We hope to keep improving this model to make it even more accurate and helpful in supporting mental health.
